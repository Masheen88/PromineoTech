/*Object Oriented Programming - Individual objects that can interact with other objects. Allows a 
much more maintainable code.
1. Abstraction: Allows you to hide complexity and instead for an overview of an object.
ie. Vehicles all move, may move differently, but they all move.
2. Encapsulation: Hiding the details of 'How' a method works.
ie. When driving, what does the engine do? YOu do not have to know, it is hidden.
3. Inheritance: Allows objects to inherit properties / functions from other properties.
4. Polymorphism: Allows objects to act differently depending on how they are called.
ie. Each animal communicates differently. All animals communicate but depending on the animal and how it communicates.

Objects can be created from classes.
Classes are like blueprint for objects to be created from.
An object is an instance of a class.
Objects and Classes are used interchangeably.
