/**
 * 
 * Just to be clear, this is NOT HOMEWORK
 * This is just for fun to do when you're bored and want something to occupy your brain
 * 
 * The challenge is:
 * 
 * 1. Have the computer pick a number. Bonus points if you figure out how to make it a randomly chosen number
 * 2. Ask the user to guess what the number is
 * 3. If the user is wrong, have the computer say whether the guess was too high or too low
 * 4. If the user is right, have the computer let the user know they won
 * 5. Wrap everything in a loop so that the user is prompted until they get the answer right
 * 6. Brownie points if you can figure out how to make it possible for the user to exit the loop by pressing 'cancel' on the prompt instead of guessing
 * 
 * I'll be uploading my solution to the problem right before next week's class. Again, there's no grade for this and it's not a part of the official coursework
 * it's just something fun to challenge yourself.
